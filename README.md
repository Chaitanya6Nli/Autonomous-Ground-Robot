>>Introduction-
Mentors: Ajinkya Deshpande, Ritwik Sharma, Vimarsh Shah


>>Course Description-
Automation and Control in Robotics is a fast-growing ﬁeld with exciting innovations coming out at a rapid pace. In this course, I will be familiarize you the basic tools and techniques that are at the core of such developments.

The course begins from scratch by covering the basics of Python including branching, looping, basic I/O and functions. The key tool I will be learning in the course is the Robotics Operating System (ROS): a software framework designed to make robotics development easier. Along with this I will also be working with Gazebo which is a robotics simulator where I can create my own robot models or even test out code on pre-existing Turtlebot.

The ﬁnal project involves putting together the skills I learned throughout the course to implement a solution for an autonomous ground robot, that I will be creating myself using URDF ﬁles to help simulate in the Gazebo environment.


>>Resources to get started-
1.Programming Robots with ROS by Morgan Quigley, William Smart and Brian Gerkey
2.ROS wiki tutorials
3.Intro to Python courses


>>Software Requirements-
Install ROS before the beginning of the QSTP.

1.Ubuntu 22.04 | Virtual Machine for windows and mac-
  a.Windows Setup
  b.Mac (intel) Setup
  c.Mac (M1/M2) Setup

2.ROS2 Humble [Note: The ROS book that we have listed as a learning resource uses an older version of ROS, but a lot of fundamentals do move over to newer ROS versions]

3.Python 3.8+

4.Useful tools: Terminator, git.

>>In this repository, I have made individual directories for weekly assignment submission.
